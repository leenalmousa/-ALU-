ALU Implementation in Verilog

Register File
The CPU has a register file with 8 registers named Reg0, Reg1, ..., Reg7. Each register is 16 bits wide.

Memory 
The memory has a size of 1024X16

Operand Selection
The CPU has two 3-bit operand selection control lines: reg1 and reg2.
These control lines determine which register is selected as the operand for the ALU. The operand selection is based on the following table:

Operand Selection	Selected Register
000	Reg0
001	Reg1
...	...
111	Reg7

The ALU performs various operations on the selected operands based on the control line "operation" using the following codes:

Operation Code	Operation	Flags
0000	Increment reg1 value
0001	Decrement 	reg1 value
0010	Subtraction (reg1value - reg2value)	
0011	Addition (reg1value + reg2value)	
0100	Store	  Store the value of register reg1 to the memory location with address stored in register reg2
0101	Load	Load a copy of the content of memory location (at address stored in reg2) to register reg1



Inputs:
operation: A 3-bit input wire that represents the operation code.
reg1: A 3-bit input wire that represents the operand selection for Op1.
reg2: A 3-bit input wire that represents the operand selection for Op2.
Outputs:
result: A 16-bit output wire that represents the result of the ALU operation.
status: A 3-bit output wire that represents the status flags.
